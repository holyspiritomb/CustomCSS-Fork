# How to use

## Userstyle manager

First, you need a userstyle manager that supports installing UserCSS.

Currently these two extensions support UserCSS, but the UserCSS is not standardized, so a userstyle may work in one, but not the other.

* Stylus for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) ![external link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136959/44433186-de548e80-a56a-11e8-8947-d3331bd6d7a1.png), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) ![external link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136959/44433186-de548e80-a56a-11e8-8947-d3331bd6d7a1.png) or [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylus/) ![external link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136959/44433186-de548e80-a56a-11e8-8947-d3331bd6d7a1.png) (recommended).
* xStyle for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/xstyle/) ![external link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136959/44433186-de548e80-a56a-11e8-8947-d3331bd6d7a1.png) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xstyle/hncgkmhphmncjohllpoleelnibpmccpj) ![external link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136959/44433186-de548e80-a56a-11e8-8947-d3331bd6d7a1.png).

## UserCSS file

Now we need to find a style to install.

* All UserCSS files have a `.user.css` ending.
* Or if you find a style in a blog post or comment, look for `/* ==UserStyle==` at the top of the style.

### Install a file

To install a file, open the file within the browser. The file can be hosted *anywhere* on the web, or on your local drive.

For example, to add a [Quora.com](https://www.quora.com/) ![external link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136959/44433186-de548e80-a56a-11e8-8947-d3331bd6d7a1.png) Dark theme, go to [Quora Dark installation instructions](https://github.com/StylishThemes/Quora-Dark#installation) ![external link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136959/44433186-de548e80-a56a-11e8-8947-d3331bd6d7a1.png) (you don't need to be logged in), then click the "Install the usercss" link.

You could also open the `.user.css` file directly if you know the url.

Once the raw `quora-dark.user.css` file is open in the browser, Stylus will open a new tab showing some basic information & options:

![quora dark usercss installation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136959/45228413-bb272000-b288-11e8-87a4-ebc615ca8f0d.png)

* Click on:
  * "Install style" to initially install the style.
  * The button will be labeled "Reinstall style" if the style is already installed.
  * Or, it'll be labeled as "Update style" if the style is already installed, and it needs to be updated.
* The "Check for updates" checkbox.
  * Check this box if you want the style to automatically update.
  * If the UserCSS includes a location, you'll see it below the checkbox label. This is the url where the style manager will look to see if the UserCss needs to be updated.
  * If no location is set, the manager will check for updates from where the UserCSS was installed by you.
  * Uncheck this box if you don't want automatic updates.
* Review the remaining information as desired.

Once installed, you will be redirected to Stylus' editor page with the newly installed/updated UserCSS loaded. Close this if you don't want or need to modify the style.

Further instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/UserCSS#usercss-file).
